# remarkJS Presentation Template

This repo is a personal template for presentations built with [remarkJS](https://github.com/gnab/remark?tab=readme-ov-file) and its theme is based upon [remark-it](https://github.com/1-2-3/remark-it)

Create your presentation content in the `presentation-content.md` in Markdown and then run a web server in this directory (*e.g.* `python3 -m http.server presentation.html`)
